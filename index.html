			<p class="bat_first">Is Marcus Mariota already one of Oregon’s mythical monument men?</p>
			<p>From Hugo Bezdek’s two-way Rose Bowl hero to Chip Kelly’s dazzling dual-threat stars, the Ducks have a rich history at quarterback.</p>
			<p>Many of the all-time greats who still follow the team believe Mariota would belong on Oregon’s Mount Rushmore of quarterbacks. If things go as planned on the field this season, the humble Hawaiian might be remembered as the best who ever laced them up for the Ducks.</p>
			<p>“I think Marcus is probably No. 1," former Oregon coach Mike Bellotti said of where Mariota ranks in the program’s pantheon of quarterbacks. “There have been great quarterbacks, and I’ve been fortunate in my career to coach some of the best quarterbacks ever to play at Oregon. …</p>
			<p>“Marcus has size, speed, athleticism, awareness, he’s been well-coached and he’s playing in a system that utilizes his strengths. He’s intelligent and he has the kind of personality and is the kind of person everyone respects."</p>
			<p>C.A. “Shy" Huntington (1914-16) willed Bezdek’s Ducks to the first Rose Bowl victory in school history on Jan. 1, 1917. The first-team all-American threw a 15-yard touchdown pass, ran for a 1-yard touchdown and made three interceptions on defense in a 14-0 victory over Penn.</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>George Shaw (1951-54), an all-American in baseball and football, set the Pacific Coast Conference record for total offense (1,536) and still owns the Oregon record for career interceptions (18). He was the No. 1 pick in the 1955 NFL draft by Baltimore.</p>
			<p>Norm Van Brocklin (1947-48) is immortalized in both the College Football Hall of Fame and Pro Football Hall of Fame. “The Dutchman" led Oregon to its first bowl game in 29 years, a 21-13 loss to SMU in the Cotton Bowl, before becoming the NFL’s three-time passing champion and two-time punting leader.</p>
			<p>Bob Berry (1962-64) — the quarterback in Len Casanova’s famed “Firehouse Four" backfield that also included Mel Renfro — guided the Ducks to three consecutive winning seasons and a Sun Bowl victory over SMU.</p>
			<p>After quarterbacking Oregon to its first postseason win in 46 years and earning first-team all-America honors, Berry played nine seasons in the NFL.</p>
			<p>“This guy is going to be the best ever at Oregon," Berry said during the 2013 season when Mariota had the Ducks in the hunt for a BCS championship after an 8-0 start. “I still follow the Ducks, I get on all the websites and read all about them. … I think he’s the best player that has ever played there. He’s got it all. He’s a big guy. Next to De’Anthony Thomas, he’s the fastest guy on the team. He’s 6-foot-4, 210 pounds, he’s smart, he makes the right decisions and he throws a great pass.</p>
			<p>“I think he’s the key. He’s kind of the glue of that team."</p>
			<h3>Best of both worlds</h3>
			<p>Mariota suffered a partially torn MCL during a 42-14 victory over UCLA last October. He played through the pain during losses at Stanford and Arizona, which derailed his Heisman Trophy charge and dashed Oregon’s national title hopes.</p>
			<p>Before the Alamo Bowl victory over Texas, Mariota announced he would return to Oregon for his redshirt junior season instead of entering the NFL draft.</p>

		<div class="bat_story">
			<p>Entering Saturday’s 2014 opener against South Dakota, Mariota is ranked No. 6 on the program’s all-time passing list with 6,342 yards (63 touchdowns, 10 interceptions) and fourth all time in total offense with 7,809 yards.</p>
			<p>Last season Mariota passed Dan Fouts (1970-72), who threw for 5,995 yards with 37 touchdown passes and 54 interceptions at Oregon before a Hall of Fame career with the San Diego Chargers.</p>
			<p>“As a fan, I think it was awesome he decided to come back," Fouts said. “He’s a very committed young man, and it tells a lot about his character and the program at Oregon."</p>
			<p>Chris Miller (1983-86) is currently one spot ahead of Mariota on the school’s all-time passing list with 6,681 yards (42 touchdowns, 39 interceptions).</p>
			<p>After earning first-team all-Pac-10 honors twice, Miller was selected No. 13 overall by the Atlanta Falcons in the 1987 draft and played 10 years in the NFL.</p>
			<p>“From an overall skill set, when you talk about terrific athletes at Oregon, you have to talk about Marcus and Akili Smith," said Miller, who is now the football coach at West Linn High. “Akili was a special athlete. Marcus’ IQ is very high, and that’s what separates him. He runs like a gazelle, has the size, and what I like is that calm, cool collective demeanor. He’s very Tom Brady-esque.</p>
			<p>“He has a chance to be the best in the history of Oregon with everything he brings to the table."</p>
			<h3>The modern chart toppers</h3>
			<p>Bill Musgrave (1987-90) followed Miller under center and took the program to another level during his four seasons as the starter. He is still the Ducks’ all-time leading passer with 8,343 yards (60 touchdowns, 40 interceptions).</p>
			<p>From 1894 to 1988, the Ducks appeared in six bowl games. Since Musgrave led Oregon to a 27-24 victory over Tulsa in the 1989 Independence Bowl with 17 unanswered points in the final 18 minutes, the Ducks have appeared in 20 bowls.</p>
			<p>Danny O’Neil (1990-94), currently second behind Musgrave in career passing (8,301 yards) and total offense (8,124 yards), threw for 456 yards and two touchdowns during Oregon’s Rose Bowl loss to Penn State.</p>
			<p>Backup Tony Graziani (1994-96) helped the Ducks pull off some key wins when O’Neil was injured during the magical 1994 season.</p>
			<p>“It’s kind of the new age at quarterback when you look at the Johnny Manziels and the Mariotas," said former Oregon coach Rich Brooks (1977-94), who left to coach the St. Louis Rams after the Ducks ended a 37-year Rose Bowl drought. “I think Mariota is obviously a tremendous talent. The question is how he will make the transition to the NFL. Some of those guys have done well, some haven’t.</p>
			<p>“When you look at a pro style quarterback, you look at Miller, Musgrave and O’Neil. We had Reggie Ogburn in 1979 and ’80. My god he could run and pass. He would be great in the system they’re running now."</p>
			<p>Nick Aliotti was Brooks’s defensive coordinator when Oregon’s “Gang Green" unit set the tone in the program-changing 1994 season. The last two years, Aliotti finished his coaching career watching Kelly and Mark Helfrich dial up game plans with Mariota.</p>
			<p>“No question, he’s No. 1," Aliotti said of Mariota. “They’re all very good. You’ve got ‘Captain Comeback’ Joey Harrington, Chris Miller, Graziani, Bob Berry, Shaw … it’s been cool.</p>
			<p>“In my mind, for what he has done and what he’s going to accomplish, the wins and losses, Mariota is No. 1."</p>
			<p>Smith (1997-98) had a spectacular statistical season in 1998, throwing for 3,763 yards and 32 touchdowns. The Pac-10 offensive player of the year was the No. 3 overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft by the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
			<p>Harrington (1998-2001) put the Ducks on the national map by leading them to three consecutive bowl victories and compiling a 25-3 record as Oregon’s starter with 10 fourth-quarter comeback victories.</p>
			<p>Before the 2001 season, Harrington’s Heisman campaign kicked off with a giant billboard in New York’s Times Square. The Ducks were snubbed for the BCS championship game and finished No. 2 in the polls after thrashing Colorado in the Fiesta Bowl.</p>
			<p>“I think that he’s the greatest quarterback to ever suit up for the Oregon Ducks," Harrington, who finished fourth in the Heisman balloting, said of Mariota last October on Comcast Sports Northwest.</p>
			<p>Harrington, picked No. 3 overall in the 2002 NFL draft by the Detroit Lions, is fourth at Oregon in career passing yards (6,289) and tied with Mariota for first in total touchdowns (77).</p>
			<p>Kellen Clemens (2002-05) is third in passing yards (7,555) and total offense (8,090). He is entering his 10th NFL season as Philip Rivers’ backup in San Diego.</p>
			<p>Dennis Dixon (2004-07) was on his own Heisman march with 2,719 yards of total offense through 10 games of the 2007 season before suffering a devastating knee injury at Arizona.</p>
			<p>Bellotti said Mariota seems to combine the leadership and intangibles Harrington brought to the program with the elite athleticism Smith and Dixon possessed in their prime.</p>
			<p>“Last year’s Civil War, I was amazed with Marcus’ performance," Bellotti said of Oregon’s 36-35 win over Oregon State, which was capped with Mariota’s game-winning touchdown pass to Josh Huff in the final seconds.</p>
			<p>“Some of those throws he made on fourth down were reminiscent of Joey Harrington. And Marcus possesses better physical talent."</p>
			<h3>Strike the pose, grab a chisel</h3>
			<p>Kelly’s innovative blur offense led the Ducks to four consecutive BCS bowl appearances with Jeremiah Masoli (2010 Rose Bowl), Darron Thomas (2011 BCS championship, 2012 Rose Bowl) and Mariota (2013 Fiesta Bowl) at quarterback.</p>
			<p>Off-field issues derailed Masoli’s career. Thomas, currently an Arena Football League player with the Portland franchise, left Oregon a year early after producing 6,629 yards of total offense, 75 touchdowns and a stellar 24-3 record.</p>
			<p>Nate Costa was an inspirational leader and team captain during his injury-plagued career with the Ducks from 2006-10. Now the former Oregon quarterback is a graduate assistant on Helfrich’s staff.</p>
			<p>“I wouldn’t want to offend Darron or Dennis, but there is no comparison. Marcus is everything that you want in a quarterback, especially in this type of offense," Costa said when asked to compare Mariota to some of his gifted teammates.</p>
			<p>“Not only does he have a great arm and great accuracy, but he is also extremely athletic and fast. He makes great decisions and just has a great grasp of the offense. We’re giving him a lot of responsibility as far as some things at the line of scrimmage, and he handles those without issue.</p>
			<p>“Marcus just does everything that Dennis and Darron and myself and Jeremiah were able to do, but condensed into one. He does it all really well. All the accolades that he has been receiving, he definitely deserves."</p>
			<p>Second-year offensive coordinator Scott Frost said he didn’t give Mariota any special treatment during fall camp. The returning starter was asked to improve his ball security when breaking out of the pocket and to be more of a vocal leader.</p>
			<p>“Great players want to be challenged as much as young players. If I was easy on Marcus and didn’t hold him to the standard he expects, I don’t think he’d appreciate that," Frost said. “He wants to be coached just as hard as the guy who’s just learning. There are still things he can improve on, there’s still things we can improve on."</p>
			<p>Mariota’s legacy will be cemented — sculpted? — if he can lead the No. 3 Ducks to their first national championship and perhaps become the first Heisman winner in school history.</p>
			<p>“He is elite or whatever the right word is now," Helfrich said. “He still has a big ceiling, which in some ways is scary. I told (Frost) that many times, ‘Hey, this ain’t normal to have a guy like this.’ …</p>
			<p>“Marcus had kind of that ‘it’ factor of guys wanting to follow him and almost thirsting for his leadership for a long time. It’s neat to see that progression."</p>
